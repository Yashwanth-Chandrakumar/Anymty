# Anymty - 100% Anonymous Messaging App

**Anymty** is a secure, anonymous messaging application built with **React Native** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. It allows users to chat freely with complete anonymity, using its own custom chat architecture and end-to-end encryption. Whether you're sending text messages, multimedia files, or voice notes, **Anymty** ensures privacy and confidentiality, making it the ultimate app for secure communications.

## Features

- **100% Anonymity**: No personal information required for registration. Users can chat without revealing their identities.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages, multimedia files, and voice notes are encrypted end-to-end, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the content.
- **Custom Chat Architecture**: Built from scratch to ensure performance, reliability, and security.
- **Multimedia Transfer**: Send and receive images, videos, audio, and other multimedia content without compromising privacy.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant text messaging with push notifications for new messages.
- **Group Chats**: Create secure group chats with full encryption, allowing a small circle of trusted users to communicate.
- **Voice and Video Calls**: Secure voice and video calling functionality with end-to-end encryption.
- **Message Self-Destruction**: Option for messages to self-destruct after a defined time.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Android and iOS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Django (with Django Channels for real-time communication)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing chat metadata)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for encryption, RSA for secure key exchange
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (via Django Channels)
- **Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3 (for storing multimedia files securely)
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication (JWT)

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: The mobile app is built with **React Native**, providing a native-like experience on both Android and iOS devices. It communicates with the backend via REST APIs for user authentication and chat functionalities, and WebSockets for real-time messaging.
- **Backend**: **Django** powers the backend, managing user authentication, chats, multimedia file handling, and encryption. We use **Django Channels** to handle WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
- **Encryption**: **AES-256** is used for encrypting the messages, while **RSA** is used for key exchange to ensure that only the intended recipients can decrypt the messages.
- **Storage**: **Amazon S3** is used to store multimedia files securely, with encryption both at rest and in transit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Node.js** (for React Native)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for package management)
- **Python 3.x** (for Django)
- **PostgreSQL** (for the database)
- **Android Studio / Xcode** (for mobile app development)
- **Docker** (optional for setting up the backend in containers)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anymty.git
cd anymty
```

### 2. Setup Frontend (React Native)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app on Android or iOS**:

   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

   - For iOS (on macOS):
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

   Ensure you have **Android Studio** or **Xcode** installed and configured.

### 3. Setup Backend (Django)

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the database**:
   Ensure **PostgreSQL** is running. Create a database for Anymty and update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

5. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Django development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### 4. Set Up WebSocket for Real-Time Messaging

To enable real-time communication, make sure **Django Channels** and WebSocket configurations are set up correctly:

1. In `settings.py`, add the necessary configurations for **Django Channels**:
   ```python
   ASGI_APPLICATION = "anymty.asgi.application"
   ```

2. Install **Channels**:
   ```bash
   pip install channels
   ```

3. Set up the WebSocket consumer in `consumers.py` and route WebSocket connections in `routing.py`.

## Usage

1. **Create an Account**: Register with an anonymous username (no personal information required).
2. **Start Messaging**: Begin sending and receiving encrypted messages instantly.
3. **Multimedia Transfer**: Send multimedia files (images, videos, audio) securely to any user or group chat.
4. **Voice & Video Calls**: Make encrypted voice and video calls with complete privacy.
5. **Message Self-Destruction**: Enable self-destruction for messages after a set period.
6. **Group Chats**: Create and join group chats, all protected by end-to-end encryption.

## Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Every message is encrypted using **AES-256**.
- **Secure Key Exchange**: We use **RSA** for secure key exchange to ensure only the recipient can decrypt the messages.
- **No Personal Data Storage**: Anymty does not store any personal data, ensuring complete anonymity.
